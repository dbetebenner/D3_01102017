New Year's Resolution for 2017: Make a D3 Block a day to teach myself D3. This is Number 10. This example
builds on [yesterday's USA school district map](https://github.com/dbetebenner/D3_01092017) adding tooltips that identify the district.
The topoJSON files used to construct this visualization were created by me using
[shape files](https://www.census.gov/did/www/schooldistricts/) provided by the United States Census Bureau.
[The Center for Assessment](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment) makes these
[state and national school district topoJSON files](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/SGPspatialData) available
for anyone to use in their own development.
